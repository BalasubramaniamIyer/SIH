Welcome to our Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project! This README provides a comprehensive overview of our objectives, key features, and guidelines for setting up and contributing to the codebase.

Please review this document to understand our workflow, the technologies we're using, and any relevant documentation. Let’s collaborate effectively and create something amazing together!



In current situations farmers are struggling to sell their product for a good price.

If they want to sell their products for a good price they should travel, or they have to work hard to sell their product and the expenses for this will be high and the rate of the product also will be increase gradually.

If a farmer did not get the correct price for their product as a consumer, we will also face financial problems in our day-to-day life. To over come this problem our team “STOIC MINDS” decided to develop a web application to make a stable market access between the farmers and the potential buyers with assured contract.

Our web application FARM-ACY will have two types of users, one is farmer group and the other one is the buyer group.

Any common user can see our web application, what is the web application about? what are the products available? But the common users cannot access further, they should register either as a farmer or a buyer. 

In the farmers dashboard a farmer can create his/her profile with profile photo, first name, last name, email id, address, Area of Cultivation (in acres).

After creating and saved the profile the details will be displayed in his/her own dashboard. 

With that a farmer can see the current weather condition of their location and the can analyze about their sales of their product and the rating of their products through the bar chart and the pie chart.

And they can see the messages that are sent by the farmers in the dashboard itself and they can accept or reject the bidding request that are given by the buyers.

If the farmer accepts a particular price that have been negotiated or bided by a buyer then the buyer will pay the amount to the farmers account and farmers will send the products to the buyer. 

And they can add the photos of their products (the products in sale) in the add product option and the added product will be display in the buyer’s page.

In the buyer’s page, a buyer could able to see what are the categories of products available for example vegetables, fruits, nuts, cereals, spices, flowers and etc.

And if he/she needed to see what are the products available under a particular category then they can click the name of the categories and see the products for example, if they click the vegetable, they can see the vegetables with their images like, Tomato, Potato, Brinjal, Carrot, Onion, Bottle guard, Bitter guard, and etc. 

And if they need to know the details of the product then they can click the view product button and see the details of the products such as, name of the product, name of the owner, rating for the product, location, price and etc. 

Here the buyer can click the Bid button and can participate in that bidding. In this bidding page a buyer can see the real image of the product that are added by farmer in the farmer’s page, a small description of the product, rating, starting price of the product, current highest bid amount, and the time left for the bidding. 

Here if the buyer needs to add his/her bid amount then they should add a value greater than the current highest bid amount.

After adding the amount, he/she will get a message “your bid has been placed”.

Here they can see the top three prices that have been placed and they can plan to bid according to that. 

After the buyer placed their bid amount the farmer will receive a message with the bided amount, if the farmer satisfies with the bid amount, then he/she can accept the price. 

After accepting the price, the buyer will get the message as your bid was accepted and now, he/she can buy the product by sending money through online or can add the product to the cart. 

If the farmer did not accept the amount, then the buyer will get a message as your bid was not accepted, then he can participate in another farmer’s bidding. 

If an order was accepted buy farmer for a buyer the transportation would be by a vehicle. 

Our web application will be connected to an organization who can afford vehicles to make this transportation successful.

The amount for this transportation will be divided among the farmer and the buyer. 

By developing this web application, all the farmers, buyers and the consumers will be profited, and the price of the product in the market will be reduced.
